Face, age, and gender detection is a significant application of computer vision and 
deep learning with wide-ranging real-world applications such as surveillance, 
demographic analysis, targeted advertising, and human-computer interaction. This 
project aims to develop a system capable of accurately detecting human faces in 
images or video streams and subsequently estimating the age group and gender of 
the identified individuals. The system utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs) and deep learning models such as OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascades for face 
detection and models like VGGNet or MobileNet for age and gender classification. 
The dataset used includes annotated images with age and gender labels to train and 
evaluate the models. The implementation ensures real-time processing with high 
accuracy, balancing model performance with computational efficiency. Experimental 
results demonstrate the model's capability to detect multiple faces simultaneously 
and predict age ranges and gender with reasonable accuracy, making it suitable for 
practical deployments in various industries.
